  "readme": "# gulp-load-plugins\n\n[![npm](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins.svg?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins/)\n\n> Loads gulp plugins from package dependencies and attaches them to an object of your choice.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven a `package.json` file that has some dependencies within:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"gulp-jshint\": \"*\",\n        \"gulp-concat\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAdding this into your `Gulpfile.js`:\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar gulpLoadPlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins');\nvar plugins = gulpLoadPlugins();\n```\n\nOr, even shorter:\n\n```js\nvar plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();\n```\n\nWill result in the following happening (roughly, plugins are lazy loaded but in practice you won't notice any difference):\n\n```js\nplugins.jshint = require('gulp-jshint');\nplugins.concat = require('gulp-concat');\n```\n\nYou can then use the plugins just like you would if you'd manually required them, but referring to them as `plugins.name()`, rather than just `name()`.\n\nThis frees you up from having to manually require each gulp plugin.\n\n## Options\n\nYou can pass in an object of options that are shown below: (the values for the keys are the defaults):\n\n```js\ngulpLoadPlugins({\n    DEBUG: false, // when set to true, the plugin will log info to console. Useful for bug reporting and issue debugging\n    pattern: ['gulp-*', 'gulp.*', '@*/gulp{-,.}*'], // the glob(s) to search for\n    overridePattern: true, // When true, overrides the built-in patterns. Otherwise, extends built-in patterns matcher list.\n    config: 'package.json', // where to find the plugins, by default searched up from process.cwd()\n    scope: ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies'], // which keys in the config to look within\n    replaceString: /^gulp(-|\\.)/, // what to remove from the name of the module when adding it to the context\n    camelize: true, // if true, transforms hyphenated plugins names to camel case\n    lazy: true, // whether the plugins should be lazy loaded on demand\n    rename: {}, // a mapping of plugins to rename\n    renameFn: function (name) { ... }, // a function to handle the renaming of plugins (the default works)\n    postRequireTransforms: {}, // see documentation below\n    maintainScope: true // toggles loading all npm scopes like non-scoped packages\n});\n```\n\n## Multiple `config` locations\n\nWhile it's possile to grab plugins from another location, often times you may want to extend from another package that enables you to keep your own `package.json` free from duplicates, but still add in your own plugins that are needed for your project. Since the `config` option accepts an object, you can merge together multiple locations using the [lodash.merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.merge) package:\n\n```js\nvar merge = require('lodash.merge');\n\nvar packages = merge(\n  require('dep/package.json'),\n  require('./package.json')\n);\n\n// Utilities\nvar $ = gulpLoadPlugins({\n  config: packages\n});\n\n```\n\n## `postRequireTransforms` (1.3+ only)\n\nThis enables you to transform the plugin after it has been required by gulp-load-plugins.\n\nFor example, one particular plugin (let's say, `gulp-foo`), might need you to call a function to configure it before it is used. So you would end up with:\n\n```js\nvar $ = require('gulp-load-plugins')();\n$.foo = $.foo.configure(...);\n```\n\nThis is a bit messy. Instead you can pass a `postRequireTransforms` object which will enable you to do this:\n\n```js\nvar $ = require('gulp-load-plugins')({\n  postRequireTransforms: {\n    foo: function(foo) {\n      return foo.configure(...);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n$.foo // is already configured\n```\n\nEverytime a plugin is loaded, we check to see if a transform is defined, and if so, we call that function, passing in the loaded plugin. Whatever this function returns is then used as the value that's returned by gulp-load-plugins.\n\nFor 99% of gulp-plugins you will not need this behaviour, but for the odd plugin it's a nice way of keeping your code cleaner.\n\n\n## Renaming\n\nFrom 0.8.0, you can pass in an object of mappings for renaming plugins. For example, imagine you want to load the `gulp-ruby-sass` plugin, but want to refer to it as just `sass`:\n\n```js\ngulpLoadPlugins({\n  rename: {\n    'gulp-ruby-sass': 'sass'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote that if you specify the `renameFn` options with your own custom rename function, while the `rename` option will still work, the `replaceString` and `camelize` options will be ignored.\n\n## npm Scopes\n\n`gulp-load-plugins` comes with [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) support. By default, the scoped plugins are accessible through an object on `plugins` that represents the scope. When `maintainScope = false`, the plugins are available in the top level just like any other non-scoped plugins.\n\n__Note:__ `maintainScope` is only available in Version 1.4.0 and up.\n\nFor example, if the plugin is `@myco/gulp-test-plugin` then you can access the plugin as shown in the following example:\n\n```js\nvar scoped = require('gulp-load-plugins')({\n  // true is the default value\n  maintainScope: true,\n});\n\nscoped.myco.testPlugin();\n\nvar nonScoped = require('gulp-load-plugins')({\n  maintainScope: false,\n});\n\nnonScoped.testPlugin();\n```\n\n## Lazy Loading\n\nIn 0.4.0 and prior, lazy loading used to only work with plugins that return a function. In newer versions though, lazy loading should work for any plugin. If you have a problem related to this please try disabling lazy loading and see if that fixes it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo too.\n\n## Override Pattern\n\nIn 1.4.0 and prior, configuring the `pattern` option would override the built-in `['gulp-*', 'gulp.*', '@*/gulp{-,.}*']`. If `overridePattern: false`, the configured `pattern` will now extends the built-in matching.\n\nFor example, both are equivilant statements.\n```js\nvar overridePlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')({\n  // true is the default value\n  overridePattern: true,\n  pattern: ['gulp-*', 'gulp.*', '@*/gulp{-,.}*', 'foo-bar']\n});\n\nvar extendedPlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')({\n  overridePattern: false,\n  pattern: ['foo-bar']\n});\n```\n\n## Credit\n\nCredit largely goes to @sindresorhus for his [load-grunt-plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) plugin. This plugin is almost identical, just tweaked slightly to work with Gulp and to expose the required plugins.\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n##### 1.5.0\n- added `overridePattern` - thanks @bretkikehara - [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/127)\n\n##### 1.4.0\n- added `maintainScope` - thanks @bretkikehara - [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/126)\n\n##### 1.3.0\n- added `postRequireTransforms` - thanks @vinitm - [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/119)\n\n##### 1.2.4\n- Fix bug in 1.2.3 release that stopped logging output in Gulp 3 - thanks @doowb\n\n##### 1.2.3\n- Update dependencies in line with Gulp 4 - [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/108) - thanks @doowb\n\n##### 1.2.2\n- revert the previous PR in 1.2.1 which broke configuration loading for some users\n\n##### 1.2.1\n- fix using the wrong `require` function - [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/104) - thanks @mwessner\n\n##### 1.2\n- throw an error if two packages are loaded that end up having the same name after the `replaceString` has been removed - thanks @carloshpds\n\n##### 1.1\n- added `DEBUG` option to turn on logging and help us debug issues - thanks @dcamilleri\n\n\n##### 1.0.0\n- added `renameFn` function to give users complete control over the name a plugin should be given when loaded - thanks @callumacrae\n\n##### 1.0.0-rc.1\n- This is the first release candidate for what will become version 1 of gulp-load-plugins.
